## What is this?

This is an app for iOS and Android that allows you to scan QR code, with the posibility of storing them in the application. Built with Dart, Flutter and SQLite.</br>
Important if you want to try this app, you need to create your own **secret.dart** file (I recommend you create it in lib/src, next to main.dart), it should has a format similar like this: </br> </br>
```
class Secrets {
  String accessTokenMapBox = 'your own Mapbox's apiKey'; 
}
```
</br></br>
Thanks for your visiting! üëç
